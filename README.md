Alter this file to report the group roles and group members[^1]:

* Repo Manager: `James (ganm2721)`
* Maintainer: `Areeb (ahma2721) Bobby (rodr2721)`
* Playtesters: Vergil, Jiwon, Muhammad, Manave

Overview:

* For this exercise your team is going to be paired with another team.
* You and the other team are developing two different versions of the same game -- Wit Arcade : Dice at War.
  * Your teams have different errors.
* You will do two types of QA tasks:
  * Playtesting - for the other team.
  * Blind testing - for your own team.

Part A. Setting up

1. Repo Manager:
   * Fork the repo.
   * Give your team mates Maintainer access.
   * Give the members of the team you are paired with Reporter access.

Part B. Play testing

2. Each of you must clone the other teams repo.
3. Play test the other team's game.
   * Create issues on their repo indicating the problems you found by playtesting.
   * Be thorough in your testing.


Part C. Blind testing

4. Use the issues reported by the playtesters to refine and add to the unit tests.
5. Reply to their issues with your more nuanced understanding of the problem gained via unit tests.

NOTE: Next week you will be in the same groups for a debugging exercise.
